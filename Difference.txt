Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

HTTP1.1:
---------------
    1.Loads web pages one element at a time, which can be slow, especially for complex sites.
    2.Sends headers with each request and response, leading to redundant data transmission.
    3.Uses separate connections for each resource, which can lead to delays due to connection setup.
    4.Requires the client to request each resource individually.
    5.Uses plain text for communication, which can be less efficient.
    6.Processes requests in the order they are received, without considering their importance.

HTTP2:
-------------
     1. Loads multiple elements simultaneously, speeding up page loading times.
     2.Compresses headers, reducing overhead and improving efficiency.
     3.Supports multiplexing, allowing multiple requests and responses to be sent over a single connection, reducing latency.
     4.Allows the server to push additional resources to the client without waiting for requests, improving performance.
     5.Utilizes a binary protocol for faster and more efficient data transfer.
     6.Supports request prioritization, allowing more critical resources to be loaded first.
